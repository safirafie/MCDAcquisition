About
*********

PyRPL is open source software that allows to use FPGA boards with
analog interfaces for measurement and control of real-world devices in
physics and engineering, notably experiments in quantum optics. It was
started in 2014 by Leonhard Neuhaus for controlling experiments in the field
of quantum physics at the Laboratoire Kastler Brossel in Paris, France.
Its was initially based on the open-source code for the `Red Pitaya <www.redpitaya.com>`_
and gradually diverged away from it. In 2016, large parts of the graphical
user interface were added to the project by Samuel Deleglise. PyRPL was finally
published as an open-source project under the GNU General Public License, Version 3
and has been online since July 2017.
