Feedback by PyRPL users
*********************************


.. admonition:: PyRPL was developed for and is one of the core components of three ongoing experiments in Quantum Cavity Optomechanics

   in the `Optomechanics and Quantum Measurement Group <http://www.lkb.upmc.fr/optomecanics/>`_ at `Laboratoire Kastler Brossel in Paris <http://www.lkb.upmc.fr/>`_.


.. admonition:: "Brilliant toolbox with an impressive number of functionalities. After quickly tuning a few parameters, we were able to lock our Fabry-Perot cavity with almost no effort."

   Dr. Jérôme Degallaix from the `Laboratoire des Matériaux Avancés in Lyon <http://lma.in2p3.fr/>`_.


.. admonition:: "I am trying PyRPL to see if we can replace the really expensive ZI-lockings to generate parametric feedback at low frequencies."

   Dr. Pau Mestres from `Rainer Blatt's Quantum Optics and Spectroscopy Group <http://www.quantumoptics.at/en/>`_ at `University of Innsbruck <https://www.uibk.ac.at/>`_.


.. admonition:: "IT WORKS! Thanks for your wonderful project :)"

   Dr. Kun Huang from the `State Key Laboratory of Precision Spectroscopy <http://www.lps.ecnu.edu.cn/>`_ at `East China Normal University <http://english.ecnu.edu.cn/>`_.


.. admonition:: "Thank you very much for your amazing PyRPL module! I have been using it continuously since last week, and it has saved us a lot of trouble already!"

   Ivan Galinsky from the `Quantum Membranes Lab, QUANTOP, Niels Bohr Institute <http://quantop.nbi.ku.dk/>`_, `University of Copenhagen <http://www.ku.dk/english/>`_.
