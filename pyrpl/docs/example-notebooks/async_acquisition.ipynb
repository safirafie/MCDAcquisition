    "Pyrpl uses the Qt eventloop to perform asynchronous tasks, but it has been set as the default loop of `asyncio`, such that you only need to learn how to use the standard python module [`asyncio`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), and you don't need to know anything about Qt. To give you a quick overview of what can be done, we present in the following block an exemple of 2 tasks running in parrallele. The first one mimicks a temperature control loop, measuring periodically a signal every 1 s, and changing the offset of an `asg` based on the measured value (we realize this way a slow and rudimentary software pid). In parrallele, another task consists in repeatedly shifting the frequency of an asg, and measuring an averaged spectrum on the spectrum analyzer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both tasks are defined by coroutines (a python function that is preceded by the keyword `async`, and that can contain the keyword `await`). Basically, the execution of each coroutine is interrupted whenever the keyword `await` is encountered, giving the chance to other tasks to be executed. It will only be resumed once the underlying coroutine's value becomes ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally to execute the cocroutines, it is not enough to call `my_coroutine()`, since we need to send the task to the event loop. For that, we use the function `ensure_future` from pyrpl.async_utils module. This function immediately returns an object that is not the result of the task (not the object that is behind `return` inside the coroutine), but rather a Future object, that can be used to retrieve the actual result once it is ready (this is done by calling `future.result()` latter on).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are executing the code inside the ipython notebook, then, this is all you have to do, since an event loop is already running in the back (a qt eventloop if you are using the option %pylab qt). Otherwise, you have to use one of the functions (`LOOP.run_forever()`, `LOOP.run_until_complete()`, or `LOOP.run_in_executor()`) to launch the eventloop."
